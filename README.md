## Contributing

### Setting up your environment

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 of the [manual installation instructions][].

[manual installation instructions]: #manual

2. Initialize a virtual environment to develop in.
   This is done so as to ensure every contributor is working with
   close-to-identicial versions of packages.

   ```sh
   mkvirtualenv xmlsec
   ```

   The `mkvirtualenv` command is available from `virtualenvwrapper` which
   can be installed by following: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation

3. Install **xmlsec** in development mode with testing enabled.
   This will download all dependencies required for running the unit tests.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   pip install -e "."
   ```

### Running the test suite

1. [Set up your environment](#setting-up-your-environment).

2. Run the unit tests.

   ```sh
   py.test tests
   ```
